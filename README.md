# NDVI_Characteristics_and_Attribution
This folder contains spatial distributions of NDVI, its interannual trends, and interannual variability. It also includes spatial distributions of the contributions of individual climatic factors to NDVI trends, multi-year average SHAP values for each factor, and the dominant drivers of both NDVI interannual trends and variability.
